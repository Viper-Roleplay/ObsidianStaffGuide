#Real-estate 






Anyone on staff can have the real estate job in city. With that being said there needs to be rules and guidelines in place to keep order and all of us on the same page. I will be placing said guidelines in this channel such as; pricing, do's and don'ts, prime locations, and MLO reserved houses. This channel is a work in progress so please bare with me as I take time to get all the information in and try to make it neat and make sense. If ever any questions about real easte, please refer to  ❓𝙃𝙤𝙪𝙨𝙚-𝙌𝙪𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨 and someone will get back to you as soon as possible!

**HOW TO PRICE A HOUSE:** 
The things we look for when setting a price for a house is as follows; Location, size of the lot, view, amenities such as pools and jacuzzies, and interiors. Garages also affect the price of the house if they decide to go with or without one. (edited)

**AMENITITES**

_**INTERIORS**_ All interiors MUST match the exterior of the house to proper fit the role play. All interiors have been priced and listed in ⁠🛏𝙄𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙤𝙧𝙨 . This price must be added to the negotiated price of the home

_**GARAGES**_
Some lots do not have the room for a garage. Since we can not place a garage on the street or in a closed gated location we may give the buyer a discount! -$50k (This discount can be applied if the buyer also decides they do not need a garage even if their lot could fit one

**HOUSE CALCULATOR;** This will help calculate the cost of house
