## Car Team Notes Channels

These are the places where car related notes will go - specific tasks for specific people can still go in their respective notes, but to keep us all organized we have made 4 channels to separate vehicle notes by tasks. Each of these channels have Templates posted and pinned in them to give you an idea of what's easiest for us to work with. Car team will react to notes when they are working on them, and delete the message once the update is sent to Ready to Go. So you will always know what point each vehicle is at in its journey and what updates to give the players.


⁠🚗・𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐬 - Car approvals channel is where staff can throw ticket links and pictures of vehicles that players are inquiring about bringing into the server. ⁠
🚗・𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐲-𝐓𝐨-𝐓𝐮𝐧𝐞 - Ready To Tune channel is where staff can throw ticket links and files for vehicles that have been approved and purchased by players to bring into the city. ⁠
🚗・𝘽𝙧𝙤𝙠𝙚𝙣-𝘾𝙖𝙧𝙨 - Broken Cars channel is where staff can throw ticket links and a brief description of any issues with any vehicles. ⁠
🚗・𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥-𝐄𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐬 - Model Edits channel is where staff can throw ticket links, [spawncodes] and a brief rundown of the work that's needed for vehicles that are already in and need love, getting customized, or just need to be debadged and optimized.
