## 🎟 Handling Gun Team Tickets🎟 

1️⃣ **Ask the player what issue they are having** *Example: Gun recoil issue, texture issue, not taking ammo, not pulling out of their pocket.* 
2️⃣ **Ask for a photo of the gun in their pocket** *(*If you have powers, look up the spawncode as well!*)* 
3️⃣ **For complex issues** *(like texture issues or recoil)*, **ask for a clip of the issue.** 
📌 **Once you have all the necessary info, take the ticket to the Gun Team Trello.**
