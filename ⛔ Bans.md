General guidelines to follow

- Always talk to people who you are giving a warning or ban too unless they aren't in city/don't respond to dm's. It's not fair to the player to be served ban before notice has been given.

- Do not relay the punishment that was served to players who reported the rule break. This is often asked for in revenge tickets.

- Always gather the context needed for scenes. 2min clips minimum, audio and initial interaction are often necessary to make a ruling. There are scenes that can be resolved without initial interaction and reporting players audio but there must be a clip.

- When in doubt do not assume, ask questions. We are all here to help, and all need multiple opinions sometimes as well as all opinions in certain situations.

- Don't share logs or player info in tickets. This is to prevent harassment towards players, and to keep our logging format confidential.

- Don't serve bans for scenes you were a part of unless absolutely necessary (modder, troll, confirmed F8). Tap in another staff member and share your POV.

- ^ Same goes for people you have issues with
