### Easiest Things to Do

1. **Google** 'page file size + your Windows version' and adjust this setting that reserves hard drive space as RAM. It should be set to **1.5x your physically installed RAM**.
2. **Search** 'Graphics' in Windows settings and enable the toggle for graphics settings.
3. Scroll down to **'Browse'**, find your FiveM and GTAV `.exe` files, and add them. Select them again, click **'Options'**, and make sure both are set to **high performance**.

These steps should only take you about **15 minutes**—even if you're struggling a bit, it’s manageable!

### If You're Still Having Issues

If the above doesn’t help, there are some **easy diagnostics** and fixes to try:

1. **Check Your Temperatures!**
   - Download and use **HWMonitor** (or any similar tool) to check your CPU temperatures.
   - If your temperatures are above **85°C - 90°C**, your CPU is likely throttling itself to prevent damage. **Regular cleaning** of your PC is essential—if it’s been a while, this could be your fix.

2. **Update Your Video Drivers**
   - Use your GPU software to update the video drivers. Look for **Geforce Experience** (NVIDIA) or **AMD Adrenaline** (for AMD GPUs).

3. **Free Up Space and Remove Unused Programs**
   - It may sound trivial, but many programs you’ve downloaded over the years may cause conflicts, resulting in stutters or lag spikes.
   - A great tool for freeing up space is **WinDirStat**, which helps you see where your drive space is being used.

### If You're Still Struggling

If you’ve followed all of the above and still have issues, it's time for a **more significant refresh**:

- If your computer is **less than 6 months old**, start by refreshing your **video drivers** using **DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller)**. This tool allows you to reinstall video drivers as if you just installed Windows.
  
- If it's been **more than 8 months** since you’ve built or received your computer, I recommend **reinstalling Windows**. Over time, Windows can get bogged down, and this step will help:
  - Redownload fresh drivers.
  - Fix hidden program conflicts or deep-rooted system errors.
  - It may sound intimidating, but it's easy—feel free to ask me for guides or links if you need help!
