## Obsidian Styles & Themes
---
### Heathy Sauce
> [!info] All the styles and themes are very opinionated. As I (Heath) have made the custom CSS to my taste, it may not be for everyone but some things are configurable if you choose.

> [!example]
> you can find snippets by going into `Settings > Appearance > Scroll to the bottom to find 'CSS Snippets'` scroll to bottom => in the snippets section click the folder Icon to open your snippets folder

Enable Heath's custom CSS styles and theme by refreshing then toggling the snippets under `Settings > Appearance > CSS Snippets` 
### Settings Recommendations
#### Style Settings Plugin
Once HeathySauce is enabled, you can use the '**Style Settings**' plugin to modify a few things like some colors, contrast & saturation amounts, and even things like changing the whole UI to bento boxes because heath likes them better.

To navigate to the 'Style Settings' open the `Settings` panel, then select the `Style Settings` tab under 'Community Plugins'
From here, you can open the Magic UI sauce dropdown and customize the look of obsidian even further for yourself. 

The intended original style is white base color with the standard color intensity, but these can all be changed to your liking

> [!tip] Tip
> These custom style settings are for your version of obsidian only and will not overwrite others style settings unless they delete and re-clone the obsidian repository
#### Appearance Settings
##### Primary/Accent Color
Open the `Settings` panel and select the `Appearance` Tab - here you will find the 'Accent Color' option. You can change it by clicking the colored circle (Purple by default)

The only correct color option here is of course the viper blue (HEX:`#0072bb`)

##### Fonts
these Appearance Settings are what I recommend for the rest of the regular fonts - unfortunately I cannot set these default for you guys - or at least I don't know how yet.

I would set all fonts to JetBrains Mono - as the styles overwrite fonts manually to things that should be Lovelo explicitly. 
###### Crash Course on Installing Fonts
If you do not have the 'jetBrains' or 'Lovelo' fonts locally on your system, reach out to heath and he can send them to you and walk you through the installation.

Extract the fonts and open them - you can `CTRL+A` select all the JetBrains stuff within the fonts/ttf directory and just right click "install all"

> [!example]
> if you are curious the 'JetBrains Mono NL' font is the same as 'JetBrains Mono' but without ligatures, for example: with ligatures `=>` becomes an actual arrow icon shown in the second pic - without ligatures would show like it does in discord: `=` `>`
