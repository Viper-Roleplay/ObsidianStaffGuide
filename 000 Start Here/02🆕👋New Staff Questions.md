Get Access to Logs:
#Logs #LogAccess

# *How Do I Use Logs?*

Using logs is pretty simple once you understand what each log can do and how to use them. When you start on staff, you‚Äôll be given access to logs. Simply message **Alter** for a login, and he‚Äôll get you set up. Once you have the login, here‚Äôs how you can start looking up logs. Let's say you want to find out who robbed someone.

### **Step 1: Copy the Robbed Person's Discord ID**
- Go into the ticket of the person who got robbed.
- Right-click their username to copy their **Discord ID**.  
   *(To grab a Discord ID, enable Developer Mode in Discord‚Äôs settings.)*

### **Step 2: Access the Logs Website**
- Go to the logs website.
- Search for the **"Robbing"** tab.
  - **Money Robbed** is separated into a different log called **'MoneyRobbed'**.

### **Step 3: Search the Logs**
- Click the search icon at the top right of the page.
- Input the **Discord ID** of the ticket creator and hit **Search**.

That‚Äôs how most logs work. You can also use other identifiers to search:

- **Citizen ID**
- **Discord ID**
- **FiveM License** (e.g., `1417e0de8dffd858353f7f14d3e054f959651ff4`)
- **In-City Username**

---

This process helps you quickly identify and investigate the relevant logs related to a specific incident.

# How Do I Know Who to Send Tickets To?

Once you‚Äôve been on staff for a while, you‚Äôll start to learn who to send tickets to via DMs. However, if you're still getting the hang of things, you can visit the **Meet The Team** tab in the **Staff Guide** to find more information. Additionally, you can check the tabs in the **Staff Discord** for each person's notes.


## What all can I do as a new member to staff?
### A Good Place to Start
Start by reaching out to **Ticket Team** members/watch how they handle tickets. These individuals can initiate tickets and route them to the appropriate teams. They might not have expertise in areas like car development, adding businesses to the city, or clothing creation, but they are skilled at managing and directing tickets to the right place. 

**Tickets are a HUGE part of keeping the city running smoothly**. Whatever you can do to help the ticket be processed faster should be done!

This will help ensure that your ticket reaches the right hands for quicker resolution.
