# 🌟 **Golden Rule**  
#StaffRules

## 🛡️ **The Purpose of Staff**  
Staff are here **voluntarily** to make the server better and more enjoyable **for everyone**, not just for their own fun.  

## ⚖️ **No Special Treatment**  
- **Staff are regular players** and do not receive special privileges regarding rule enforcement.  
- As staff, we should **set an example** for others to follow.  

## 🧠 **Use Common Sense**  
- **DO NOT** exploit loopholes or use technicalities to justify problematic behavior.  
  - ❌ *"The rules say this is sometimes okay."*  
  - ❌ *"Well, so-and-so did it, so why can’t I?"*  
- If you **consistently create issues** and fail to self-moderate, **YOU** will be treated as the problem.  

## 🚫 **No One is Exempt**  
- **All staff members**, from **Head Admins** to newly hired **Discord Mods**, must follow these policies and server rules.  
- **Do not be a hypocrite.**  

## ⚠️ **Accountability & Consequences**  
- There is **no strict "strike" system** for staff.  
- Staff may face **demotion, removal, or other consequences** if they break policies.  
- **The most serious offense:** **Abusing rank for personal gain.**  
- Consequences depend on **context and intent**—good-natured mistakes will be viewed differently than intentional misconduct.  

## 🎭 **Professionalism with Personality**  
- Staff should maintain a **moderate level of professionalism** in interactions.  
- However, **not everything is a crisis**—know when to take things seriously and when to be more relaxed.  
- **Find the balance** between being respectful and not sounding like an emotionless machine.

By following these principles, we ensure a **fair, fun, and well-moderated** environment for all. 🚀

# ⚖️ **Bias & Objectivity**  

## 🔹 **Know When to Step Back**  
If you are **too heated** to handle a ticket fairly, **hand it off** to another staff member.  
- We have **30+ staff members**—this should not be difficult in most cases.  

## 🚨 **NEVER Handle Your Own Tickets**  
- Staff **must not** handle their own reports, issues, or conflicts.  
- Be mature enough to recognize when **personal bias** might affect your judgment.  

## 🛑 **Conflict of Interest**  
If you are **involved in a conflict**, take a step back and **let another staff member handle it.**  
- **Example:**  
  - If someone is **spamming or flooding a channel**, you can step in regardless.  
  - If someone **wronged you in-city**, you **must** let another staff member handle the situation.  

## ❓ **Unsure About a Ticket? Ask!**  
- If you’re unsure **how to handle an issue**, this guide provides:  
  - Who to go to for assistance.  
  - What each staff member specializes in.  

## 🎧 **Staff VC is Mandatory**  
- If you are **handling tickets, moderating, or working on the server**, you **must** be in **Staff VC**.  
- **Why?**  
  - This lets **Higher-Ups** know you’re active and working.  
  - **Not being in Staff VC = Not showing up.**

Following these guidelines ensures **fairness, transparency, and accountability** within the staff team. 🚀
