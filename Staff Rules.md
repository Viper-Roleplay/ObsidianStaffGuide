**Golden Rule**

Staff are here to voluntarily make the server better and more enjoyable for all, rather than only for their own enjoyment.



Staff are pretty much regular players and do not get any special treatment when it comes to rule enforcement. As staff we should be setting an example for others to follow.

Much like with rules for players, USE. COMMON. SENSE. IF you choose to make yourself consistently the problem, and excuse it with "the rules said this is sometimes okay", “Well so and so did this then why can’t I”, YOU will be treated as the problem for a lack of self-moderation.

No staff member is exempt from these policies or the server's rules, whether it's the Head Admins who set these policies or newly hired Discord mods. Do not be a hypocrite.

There is no concrete "strike" system for staff, but staff are subject to demotion, removal, or miscellaneous sanctions if they break these policies, with severities dependent on context and if the intention was good-natured - we look most harshly upon staff abusing rank for personal gain.

We expect staff to have a mild-moderate amount of professionalism in interactions, but also strive to be able to tell when something shouldn't be taken with the utmost seriousness.

Meaning you are expected to take things seriously when needed but should not sound like emotionless machines when doing so. Find the balance to know when things are serious and when they are not.


**Bias**


If you are too heated to handle a ticket/issue in an unbiased way, hand it off to other staff if possible. We have >30 staff members, this shouldn't be hard in most cases.

***Staff must never handle their own tickets.***

We expect staff to be mature enough to realize when a personal issue will cause bias in judgment as well.

This means if you are involved with a conflict, stop, sit back, and ask your peers to handle it for you.

There's a bit of nuance to this sometimes - If someone is flooding/spamming a channel it doesn't matter if you're an unrelated party or the person they were feuding with, while if you are upset someone wronged you in city, you should definitely ask for someone else.

Ask questions if you're not sure about a ticket or how to handle something. This Guide will tell you who to go to and what most people handle within staff.

If you are in city, handling tickets or doing some kind of work for the server, YOU MUST BE IN STAFF VC. Being on staff vc lets the Higher Ups know you are working on something and active. Failing to be in staff vc will be seen as failing to show up.

If you want to take a break, take the time to re-acquaint yourself, make an LOA.
