## üìπ **New Video Tutorial!**
#Stash #DJ #Polyzone #Vector #Garage
I heard the feedback that my previous video was a bit too fast to follow, so I went ahead and **remade it** at a more reasonable speed! üòÑ

For anyone wondering how to do things like **garages**, **stashes**, or **DJ scripts**, I‚Äôve put together a tutorial that also works for **polyzones** and **vectors** in general!

‚ú® Here's the video:  
[Watch the Tutorial](https://youtu.be/BYL3ofeqDSg)
### üîë **Important Notes**:

- Most of this info goes into **Liam‚Äôs notes** on Monday, unless told otherwise by **Frank** ü§† or **Cici**.
- If you don‚Äôt have access to Monday, let **Brian** know!

### For **stashes** and **DJ scripts**:

- You‚Äôll need either a **JOB** to tie it to or the **CSN** of the person who purchased it. So, make sure to **get that info** from the person who made the ticket!

---

## Stashes
#Stash
- **Info Needed**: Polyzone
- **Info to say to the player**: 
    We need screenshots of the location you‚Äôd like it to be, both the object you want it on as well as where it is on the map. Common places are doors or shipping containers, but anything that could somewhat realistically be used for storage should be ok. Make sure there‚Äôs not anything else there by third eyeing the area. We also need a list of CIDs (the three letters followed by some numbers next to your character name on the select screen or on your ID card in city) of people you want to have access. It can also be tied to a gang or job (everyone in that gang or with that job will be able to access), if you prefer.
- **Notes**: 
    - Stashes shouldn‚Äôt be placed too close to things like public crafting areas. 
    - Commonly denied spots are inside Fort Zancudo or inside paydirt processing. Nearby is fine, just not too close.
    - If you‚Äôre not sure if a location is allowed, ask. 
    - If you‚Äôre making the polyzone, please double check that there‚Äôs nothing there already so we don‚Äôt have an issue with overlapping polyzones.

## DJ Scripts
#DJ
- **Info Needed**: Vector3
- **Info to say to the player**: 
    We just need the location of where you want it. It can also be locked to a job if you like, that way only people with the job can access it.
- **Notes**: 
    - If the script is going to be in a larger building, the player may only want it to cover a certain part. It‚Äôs worth asking, as devs can adjust it as needed when it‚Äôs put in. 
    - It‚Äôs best to keep them somewhere somewhat realistic. 
    - The script doesn‚Äôt actually place any props in the map, just makes it so a menu pops up when you walk to the location.

---

## Garages (Also applies to helipads, boat garages, gang garages, gang helis, etc)
#Garage
- **Info Needed**: Vector4
- **Info to say to the player**: 
    We just need to know where you want it. Screenshots of both the area and the location on the map are helpful. Keep in mind we like to keep it in a somewhat realistic location.
- **Notes**: 
    - Let‚Äôs not have anything crazy like a helipad in the middle of the street or a garage on a roof.
    - Remember that the direction your ped model is facing is extremely important when getting the vector4.
    - When a vehicle pulls out, it will be much longer than the player ped, so leave some extra room behind to avoid weird issues with it hitting stuff as it spawns.
    - If it's a public garage/helipad, ask if they want a map blip for it. I recommend it.

---

## Bar Jobs
#BarJob
- **Info Needed**: Item list, images, polyzones for supplies, counter (also sometimes crafting, drink menu, boss menu, depends on bar area on what‚Äôs doable)
- **Info to say to the player**: 
    With the complex script for the bar, you get up to 10 items of your choice, along with a boss menu, register, and counter. These can be any combination of food and drink as long as it‚Äôs not more than 10. We just need item names and images for them. If you want an item with a buff effect like stamina, it‚Äôs a complex script for a single item, and you can only have one per business.
- **Notes**: 
    - The polyzones for bar jobs can be tricky if you‚Äôre not sure how we normally do them because of how unique each one is.
    - If you have questions, just ask.
    - If you really want to get on my good side, you can cut the backgrounds out of the images and resize them to 100x100 for me. (No capital letters in file names please)

## TV Screens
#TV 
- **Info Needed**: Screenshot of location
- **Info to say to the player**: 
    We just need to know where you want the screen. Two people get to have access to the `/hall` command (you and one other person). We‚Äôll need both your CID (the 3 letters followed by some numbers next to your character name on the select screen) and theirs. Keep in mind, this is much more complex than a regular DJ script and therefore takes a bit longer to implement. Your patience is greatly appreciated.
- **Notes**: 
    - These can take a while because Bobby and Cici have to do them together, and it gets to be a really tedious process with getting everything in the right spots.
    - With all Cici and Bobby do, it can take a long time to get implemented, so try to manage expectations that this isn‚Äôt something that‚Äôs gonna be put in overnight.

## Gathering Information

### Polyzone
#Polyzone
- **How to Create a Polyzone**:
    1. Do `/pzcreate box` to start. Give it a name that‚Äôs descriptive of what it‚Äôs for.
    2. For the length and width, you‚Äôll just have to get a feel for it as you do a few. Commonly, I use 1.5 length and 0.5 width for doors. You want it to be as small as possible while still covering the entire object you‚Äôre placing it on.
    3. Once you get through the UI, you‚Äôll be able to rotate the zone with the mouse wheel, and use **Ctrl + mouse wheel** for finer adjustments.
    4. **LSHIFT + mouse wheel** will change the length. Width cannot be changed from what you put in the UI.
    5. You can use arrow keys to place the zone where you need. 
    6. Once you have the zone placed where you want it, press **Z**, use the scroll wheel to bring it down to the height of the object, press **Z** again. **THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.**
    7. Do `/pzfinish` to finalize the zone or `/pzcancel` to start over.

- **Notes**:
    - These aren‚Äôt hard to do but can take some getting used to if you‚Äôve never really made them. 
    - Feel free to play around with making them so you can get a feel for it, just do `/pzcancel` if it‚Äôs not a zone that‚Äôs going to actually be used.

### Vector3
#Vector #Vector3
- **How to Copy Vector3**:
    1. Open 919, click ‚Äú**copy vector3**‚Äù.
    2. In the test server, you can also do `/vector3` or go to **/admin > dev options > copy vector3**.
    3. This automatically puts the info into your clipboard. Paste it somewhere immediately so you don‚Äôt lose it accidentally.

---

### Vector4
#Vector #Vector4
- **How to Copy Vector4**:
    1. Same process as Vector3, just choose **Vector4** instead of Vector3.
    2. **Important**: The direction your ped model is facing is very important for a vector4. Your ped model, not the camera.
    3. **VECTOR4 CANNOT BE GOTTEN THROUGH 919. IT MUST BE GOTTEN THROUGH /admin OR /vector4 IN THE TEST SERVER**.

---

## Final Notes
- You need powers to be able to get polyzones and coordinates. 
- If you don‚Äôt have powers in main, I‚Äôll be more than happy to whitelist you and give you powers in the test server. Just let me know.
- You also get to shoot all the locals you want in the test server (even with tanks üòâ ), so it‚Äôs pretty great there.
