## Answering Tickets

Each team has a guideline for starting off their tickets under their respective team guides. These guides are essential to help you support the team effectively. Even if you can't directly tune cars, you can assist with finding details about the car or providing basic info regarding the cost of 1of1s.

### Tebex/Payments

When a **Tebex** payment ticket comes through, the first step is to rename the ticket accordingly. You will then need to confirm the payment by asking the customer for a screenshot of their receipt or asking them to provide the **Tebex code**. Once the payment is confirmed, proceed with fulfilling the player’s purchase. Keep in mind, each purchase might have different requirements, so be ready to handle a variety of follow-up actions.

### House Purchases

When a player buys a house, ask for the following:

1. **Screenshot of the house's location** (outside view)
2. **Desired interior** (after sharing the showcase video from the real estate channel: [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1sLWiCE1vE))

Be sure to remind the player to keep the interior in line with the property’s style for realism. Once the required details are provided, tag the **Real Estate Team** or personally DM them the ticket link for further processing.
