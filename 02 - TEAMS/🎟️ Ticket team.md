# 🎫 Answering Tickets  

Each team has a guideline for starting off their tickets under their respective **team guides**. These guides are essential to help you support the team effectively. Even if you can't directly tune cars, you can still assist by:  
- Finding details about a car. 🚗  
- Providing basic info regarding the cost of **1of1s**. 💰  

## 🎯 Your Goal as Ticket Team  
Your main objective is to **get a ticket moving** before handing it off to the appropriate team. You can:  
✅ Observe how others handle tickets.  
✅ Review each team's info to learn the required **starting details** for different ticket types.  

## 📌 General Ticket Information  

Below are some examples of **non-team-specific info** that should be on hand. Additionally, we have a set of **`!commands`** to quickly provide details on various topics.  

💡 _By staying informed and proactive, you can ensure smoother ticket resolutions and better team collaboration!_ 🚀

### Tebex/Payments
#Tebex #Payment
When a **Tebex** payment ticket comes through, the first step is to rename the ticket accordingly. You will then need to confirm the payment by asking the customer for a screenshot of their receipt or asking them to provide the **Tebex code**. Once the payment is confirmed, proceed with fulfilling the player’s purchase. Keep in mind, each purchase might have different requirements, so be ready to handle a variety of follow-up actions.
