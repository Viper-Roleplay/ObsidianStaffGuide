## Answering Tickets

Each team has a guideline for starting off their tickets under their respective team guides. These guides are essential to help you support the team effectively. Even if you can't directly tune cars, you can assist with finding details about the car or providing basic info regarding the cost of 1of1s.

### Tebex/Payments
#Tebex #Payment
When a **Tebex** payment ticket comes through, the first step is to rename the ticket accordingly. You will then need to confirm the payment by asking the customer for a screenshot of their receipt or asking them to provide the **Tebex code**. Once the payment is confirmed, proceed with fulfilling the player’s purchase. Keep in mind, each purchase might have different requirements, so be ready to handle a variety of follow-up actions.
