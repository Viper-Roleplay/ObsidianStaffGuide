## ⚙️ **Setting Up /TPTOEVENT**⚙️

To enable teleporting to an event, use the following commands:

1. `/seteventon true` – Activates event mode.
2. `/seteventcoords` – Sets the event location.

## 🎟️ **Handling Event Tickets**🎟️

When a new event request ticket comes in, ask the following:

1. **Date** – When would you like your event?
2. **Time** – What time should the event take place?
3. **Type** – What kind of event is this? _(e.g., Grand Opening, Car Show, Wedding)_

🔗 Once you have this information, link the ticket to the **Event Team Ticket Channel** [Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/948070993518288936/1166159277543674006)  for further coordination.
