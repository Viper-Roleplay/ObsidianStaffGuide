## ⚙️ **Setting Up /TPTOEVENT**⚙️
#/tptoevent #/command 

To enable teleporting to an event, use the following commands:

1. `/seteventon true` – Activates event mode.
2. `/seteventcoords` – Sets the event location.
3. /seteventon false - Deactivates event mode.

## 🎟️ **Handling Event Tickets**🎟️

When a new event request ticket comes in, ask the following:

1. **Date** – When would you like your event?
2. **Time** – What time should the event take place?
3. **Type** – What kind of event is this? _(e.g., Grand Opening, Car Show, Wedding)_

🔗 Once you have this information, link the ticket to the **Event Team Ticket Channel** [Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/948070993518288936/1166159277543674006)  for further coordination.

# 📌 When at Events  

### 🎯 Primary Objective  
Your main reason for being there should be to **help Frosty & the event team**—make their job easier and support the event's success.  

### 🗣️ Handling Questions  
If someone asks a question and **you know the answer**, don’t make them track down the event leader for **simple things**. Help them directly.  

### 🚦 Event Presence  
When you arrive:  
- **Be an asset, not a headache.**  
- The **community, conflicts, and chaos** are already enough—don’t add to it.
