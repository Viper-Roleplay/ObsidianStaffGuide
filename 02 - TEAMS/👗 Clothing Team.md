# **Clothing Ticket Process**

1. **Determine the Clothing Type and Payment**  
    Once you confirm what the player is looking for (Simple, Complex, or Advanced Clothing), confirm the payment amount based on their selection (get clothing team approval before requesting a payment confirmation).
    
2. **Determine Creator Details**  
    Find out if the player has their own creator making the item or if they need our Clothing Team to create it.
    
    - **If they have a creator**:  
        Ask the player for a photo of the clothing/chain for approval.
    - **If they want our Clothing Team to create it**:  
        There is an additional fee to the creator.
        - Send the ticket to **Merlin** or link it in his tickets so he can discuss pricing and details with the player.

## **Clothing Tickets**

When a player opens a ticket for a custom clothing item, determine which payment tier applies:

### **SIMPLE CLOTHING** - **$30**

#SimpleClothing  
This covers basic alterations and modifications to existing items. The following fall under the Simple Clothing category:

- **Texture Change**: Adding a new texture or logo to an already existing piece of clothing (Example: changing the design on a shirt).
- **Unisex Conversion**: Making an existing item unisex _(Please note: not all models can be converted to unisex, so make sure to open a ticket beforehand to confirm its feasibility)._

---

### **COMPLEX CLOTHING** - **$60**

#ComplexClothing  
For more intricate clothing requests, this category includes:

- **Importing New Models**: Importing an entirely new model into the city _(Please note that the model must meet the city's standards, so always open a ticket before purchasing or having it made)_.
- This category covers:
    - Pants
    - Shirts
    - Masks
    - Hats _(Currently at full capacity, no more hats will be added at this time)_
    - Vests
    - Shoes
    - Bags

---

### **ADVANCED CLOTHING** - **$100**

#AdvancedClothing  
The next tier, which includes:

- **Chains**: These are both wearable chains and physical items. Chains fall under the advanced clothing category.  
    _(Again, please ensure you open a ticket for approval before having these made)._
    - **Note**: This price only covers pushing the chain to the city. An additional charge applies if you want the chain created.

### **1 of 1 Clothing** - **$150**
#1of1Clothing
These items are license-locked to ONE player. This is the highest-tier clothing item that will prevent anyone else in the city from wearing it.
