# Gang Coordinator Guidelines  

### Staff-Only Gang Coordination  
Only select members of staff are allowed to work as gang coordinators. This is because the rules differ for both whitelisted and non-whitelisted gangs.  

If you plan to assist in any way, please make sure to **read the gang rules** and ensure that the information you provide is accurate.

Before forwarding the request, gather the following information:  
1. **Why are you leaving?**  
2. **What gang are you trying to join?**  
3. **What gang are you leaving?**  

### 📌 Next Steps  
🔹 Once you’ve collected these answers, **forward the ticket** to the **Gang Coordinator section** in the Staff Discord.  
🔹 **Move the ticket** to the appropriate section.  

✅ **Done!** The Gang Coordinator team will handle it from here.
