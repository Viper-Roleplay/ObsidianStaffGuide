# 🏎️ Vehicle tickets & Organization  
#Ticket #CarTicket #CarTuning 

🚗 **Where Car-Related Notes Go**  
We’ve set up **four channels** to keep vehicle notes organized by task. While **specific tasks** for individuals can still go in their respective notes, these channels help us stay coordinated.  

📌 **How It Works:**  
- Each channel has **Templates** pinned to show the preferred format.  
- The **Car Team will react** to notes when they begin working on them.  
- Once an update is **sent to "Ready to Go," the message will be deleted** to keep things clean.  

✅ This system ensures you **always know where each vehicle is in its journey** and what updates to provide to players.  

⁠🚗・𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐬 - Car approvals channel is where staff can throw ticket links and pictures of vehicles that players are inquiring about bringing into the server. ⁠
🚗・𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐲-𝐓𝐨-𝐓𝐮𝐧𝐞 - Ready To Tune channel is where staff can throw ticket links and files for vehicles that have been approved and purchased by players to bring into the city. ⁠**Cars should be paid for before they are put here.**
🚗・𝘽𝙧𝙤𝙠𝙚𝙣-𝘾𝙖𝙧𝙨 - Broken Cars channel is where staff can throw ticket links and a brief description of any issues with any vehicles. ⁠
🚗・𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥-𝐄𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐬 - Model Edits channel is where staff can throw ticket links, [spawncodes] and a brief rundown of the work that's needed for vehicles that are already in and need love, getting customized, or just need to be debadged and optimized.

## 🔄 Conversion Rules  
- **All Whitelisted Promos (PD & EMS) have a civilian promo option.**  
- If someone **leaves PD/EMS**, they can convert their promo into the **civilian version** **(ONE-TIME ONLY).**  
- The individual **must be the original Tebex owner** and provide **proof of purchase.**  
  - ❌ Vehicles bought **in-city from another player** are **not eligible** for conversion.  
  - 🚫 **No cross-job conversions** (e.g., EMS → PD or PD → EMS).  
  - ✅ **Only whitelisted → civilian conversions are allowed.**  
  - ❌ Civilian vehicles **cannot** be converted into whitelisted vehicles.  

This ensures **fairness and clarity** in the conversion process. 🚗💨
