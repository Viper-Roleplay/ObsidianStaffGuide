## 🎟 Handling Gun Team Tickets 🎟 

1️⃣ **Ask the player what issue they are having** *Example: Gun recoil issue, texture issue, not taking ammo, not pulling out of their pocket.* 
2️⃣ **Ask for a photo of the gun in their pocket** *(*If you have powers, look up the spawncode as well!*)* 
3️⃣ **For complex issues** *(like texture issues or recoil)*, **ask for a clip of the issue.** 

📌 **Once you have all the necessary info, take the ticket to the Gun Team Trello.**

Gun Trello

Gun Trello is used to track all gun issues for the gun team to handle tickets more effectively. The following info is needed before making a trello note:

1. Gun name (if you're a mod+ fly in city and get the spawncode, without the spawncode we need a photo of the gun in the players pocket)
2. Determine the gun issue (texture issue, tuning issue (ex. recoil/supressor), no item photo).
3. Based on the issue you will use one of the following note templates: Broken Gun, Gun Tunes, Needs Image, or New Gun. Make sure you fill out EVERY QUESTION. This includes your name so we can ask questions when needed! Move the template the corresponding section once created.
	1. Broken Gun: These are guns that don't pull out or guns that crash people when pulled. If you find a gun that crashes people this should be sent into dms IMMEDIATELY. Please also put it in trello
	2. Gun Tunes: Guns that mechanically aren't preforming properly. Guns that don't do damage, have no recoil, or need a recoil update.
	3. Needs Image: This is self explanatory. Need the weapon spawncode (should be visible from an image in their pocket).
	4. New Guns: These are new 1of1 guns/gang guns/2of2 etc. These should be pre-approved by the gun team and must be paid BEFORE going in trello

## 🚨 Gun Duping Warning 🚨

⚠️ **When giving out guns, spawn them one at a time!** Otherwise, their serial numbers will **duplicate.**
