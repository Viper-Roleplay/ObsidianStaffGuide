## 🎟 Handling Gun Team Tickets 🎟 

1️⃣ **Ask the player what issue they are having** *Example: Gun recoil issue, texture issue, not taking ammo, not pulling out of their pocket.* 
2️⃣ **Ask for a photo of the gun in their pocket** *(*If you have powers, look up the spawncode as well!*)* 
3️⃣ **For complex issues** *(like texture issues or recoil)*, **ask for a clip of the issue.** 

📌 **Once you have all the necessary info, take the ticket to the Gun Team Trello.**

# 🔖 Gun Trello

Gun Trello is used to track all gun issues for the gun team to handle tickets more effectively. The following info is needed before making a Trello note:

🔹 **Gun Name:** If you're a mod+, fly in-city and get the spawncode. If unavailable, get a photo of the gun in the player’s pocket.  
🔹 **Gun Issue:** Determine the issue (e.g., texture issue, tuning issue—recoil/suppressor, missing item photo).
🔹 **Use the Correct Note Template:** Make sure you fill out EVERY QUESTION. This includes your name so we can ask questions when needed! Move the template the corresponding section once created.
- **Broken Gun:** Guns that don’t pull out or crash players when pulled. If a gun crashes players, report it via DMs IMMEDIATELY and add it to Trello.
    
- **Gun Tunes:** Guns that aren't performing properly (e.g., no damage, no recoil, or require recoil updates).
    
- **Needs Image:** A missing weapon spawncode. (This should be visible in an image of the gun in their pocket.)
    
- **New Guns:** New _1of1_, _gang guns_, _2of2_, etc. These must be pre-approved by the gun team and **paid for** before being added to Trello.

## 🚨 Gun Duping Warning 🚨

⚠️ **When giving out guns, spawn them one at a time!** Otherwise, their serial numbers will **duplicate.**
