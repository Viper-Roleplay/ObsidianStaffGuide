Welcome to Admin!

As an Admin, you are in a position to help everyone below you and assist higher-ups when needed! At this point you should be fluent in most niche ticket requests and be able to direct other staff members to the right people for answers.

Another part of being an Admin is choosing your team to contribute further! You should slowly be becoming a hub of information for others to come to.
