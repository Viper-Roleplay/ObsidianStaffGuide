## Welcome to Moderator!  
# âš¡ Fresh Powers  

Congratulations on becoming a **Moderator**! ðŸŽ‰  
You now have access to a **new arsenal** of powers, commands, and abilities to support your fellow staff and the city as we continue to grow.  

## ðŸ›‘ Responsible Use of Powers  

Having powers is a **big step up** from Staff Support, bringing **greater responsibility**. However, with great power comes great discretion!  

ðŸš¨ **Key Guidelines:**  
- **Do NOT use powers openly** in front of **civilians** or **players**.  
- Assume **eyes are always on you**â€”players may be around the corner or **streaming the server**.  
- If you need to use noclip:  
  - **Run around a corner**, get some distance, or hide behind a building first.  
  - Always activate it **out of sight**.  
- If you need to spawn a vehicle:  
  - **Use a parking lot** to make it look like itâ€™s coming out of a garage.  
  - Maintain **city realism**.

# ðŸ”‘ Use of Powers  

As a **Moderator**, you are still **out of the economy**! This means:  

ðŸš« **You CANNOT:**  
- Spawn **money, items, or weapons** for yourself, friends, or players.  
- Give **vehicles** to players.  
- Change **civilian ped models** without approval.  

âœ… **Roleplay Exceptions:**  
- In **group RP scenarios** (e.g., a bank heist), you may provide **necessary items** to players **on occasion**.  
- If unsure, **always ask** before proceedingâ€”we wonâ€™t bite! ðŸ˜Š

## ðŸ’° Economy Integrity  

To maintain fairness in the economy:  
- **Do NOT spawn** large amounts of money.  
- **Avoid weapon duplication**:  
  - Spawning weapons using **919** with an amount **greater than 1** can create **duplicate serial numbers**.  
  - Keeping serial numbers unique helps staff **track illegal duplicates**
