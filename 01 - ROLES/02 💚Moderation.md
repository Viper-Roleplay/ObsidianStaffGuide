## Welcome to Moderator!  
# ⚡ Fresh Powers  
#Powers #Moderator
Congratulations on becoming a **Moderator**! 🎉  
You now have access to a **new arsenal** of powers, commands, and abilities to support your fellow staff and the city as we continue to grow.  

## 🛑 Responsible Use of Powers  

Having powers is a **big step up** from Staff Support, bringing **greater responsibility**. However, with great power comes great discretion!  

🚨 **Key Guidelines:**  
- **Do NOT use powers openly** in front of **civilians** or **players**.  
- Assume **eyes are always on you**—players may be around the corner or **streaming the server**.  
- If you need to use noclip:  
  - **Run around a corner**, get some distance, or hide behind a building first.  
  - Always activate it **out of sight**.  
- If you need to spawn a vehicle:  
  - **Use a parking lot** to make it look like it’s coming out of a garage.  
  - Maintain **city realism**.

# 📢 Handling In-City Reports  
#Reports
A **major responsibility** as a **Moderator** is responding to **player reports** in the city! Reports will:  
✅ **Appear in the top right** of your screen.  
✅ **Play a sound** when received.  

These reports **should NEVER be ignored**—they come from players experiencing **issues** that need staff assistance.

## 🛠️ How to Assist  

1️⃣ **Open your 919 Menu** and navigate to **Reports**.  
2️⃣ Review the details of the report to determine the issue.  
3️⃣ **Take action based on the situation:**  
   - **Stuck Player?**  
     - TP to them and help them get unstuck.  
   - **Modder Report?**  
     - TP to the reporter and attempt to locate the suspect.  
     - **Warn/Kick/Ban** as necessary depending on the situation.

## 🧠 Using Your Best Judgment  

- If a player reports that **EMS hasn’t helped them in 20+ minutes**:  
  ✅ **Check if EMS is online** and determine if they need help.  
  ✅ EMS may be **backed up**, and support might be needed.  
  ❌ Some players may **lie** to get a **quick revive**—always verify first!  

By staying **proactive** and using **good judgment**, you help keep the city **fair and enjoyable** for everyone. Keep up the great work! 🚀

# 🔑 Use of Powers  

As a **Moderator**, you are still **out of the economy**! This means:  

🚫 **You CANNOT:**  
- Spawn **money, items, or weapons** for yourself, friends, or players.  
- Give **vehicles** to players.  
- Change **civilian ped models** without approval.  

✅ **Roleplay Exceptions:**  
- In **group RP scenarios** (e.g., a bank heist), you may provide **necessary items** to players **on occasion**.  
- If unsure, **always ask** before proceeding—we won’t bite! 😊

## 💰 Economy Integrity  

To maintain fairness in the economy:  
- **Do NOT spawn** large amounts of money.  
- **Avoid weapon duplication**:  
  - Spawning weapons using **919** with an amount **greater than 1** can create **duplicate serial numbers**.  
  - Keeping serial numbers unique helps staff **track illegal duplicates**
