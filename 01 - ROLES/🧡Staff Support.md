#StaffSupport #zdiscord 

Welcome to Staff Support!

Once you get promoted to Staff Support your responsibility increases! You now have the power to give items and assist Moderators! This will be done using ZDiscord which you will read more about below. Alongside ZDiscord, you will now be expected to lead tickets more. You have some experience with tickets and should be able to direct all tickets to necessary teams/individuals as well as ask the priming questions to get a ticket going. If you need a refresher, check out all the Team sections below to learn what each team needs!

You should also start thinking about what team you want to join! Staff has a lot of options to assist the city further and all teams could use assistance. Once you decide what team sounds interesting to you, reach out to the head/lead for that team to learn more!
