## 📌 Handling New Tickets  

1️⃣ **Greet the player** and let them know you’re directing them to the appropriate team.  
2️⃣ **Rename & move the ticket** to the necessary Discord section.  
3️⃣ **Use the correct naming format:**  
   - Prefix all tickets with **`i-`** for status updates.  
   - Keep names **short & clear** (Example formats below):  
     - 🏎️ **Car parking issue** → `i-name-car-park-issue`  
     - 🔬 **Drug processing error** → `i-name-drug-error`  
     - 🎨 **1 of 1 Inquiry** → `i-name-1of1-inquiry`  

4️⃣ **Use `/status`** to update ticket progress:  
   - _Waiting for player response_  
   - _Waiting for Head Admin+_  
   - _Issue resolved_

## 👀 Moderating Public Channels  

🔸 Keep an eye on **public channels** for misuse.  
🔸 If a conversation starts in an **in-game photo channel**, ask users to **move it to general chat**.  
🔸 **Remove off-topic messages** that don’t contain photos.  
🔸 Players can briefly **reply to a photo**, but **full conversations should be deleted**.  

Your role is **crucial** in keeping Discord organized and running smoothly—thank you for stepping up! ❤️
