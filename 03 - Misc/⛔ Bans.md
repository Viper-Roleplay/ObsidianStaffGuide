# General Guidelines to Follow
#Ban #Bans #Warning

### 1. **Talk to Players Before Serving Warnings/Bans**
   - Always try to speak with players you are giving a warning or ban to unless they arenâ€™t in the city or don't respond to DMs. It's important to give the player notice before a punishment is served. Itâ€™s not fair to ban them without communication.

### 2. **Do Not Relay Punishments to Reporters**
   - Do not share the punishment that was served with the players who reported the rule break. This is often requested in **revenge tickets**, and sharing this information could lead to unnecessary drama.

### 3. **Gather Proper Context for Scenes**
   - Ensure you gather all necessary context before making a ruling:
     - **2-minute clips minimum**
     - **Audio and initial interaction** are often needed to make a proper ruling.
   - Some scenes can be resolved without initial interaction or reporting player audio, but there must still be a clip.
   - **Any ticket submitted over 24 hours ago is void.** This prevents players from filing revenge tickets after the fact.

### 4. **When in Doubt, Ask Questions**
   - Never assume. If youâ€™re unsure, ask questions. Weâ€™re all here to help one another.
   - Sometimes, it's best to get **multiple opinions** or **all opinions** in certain situations.

### 5. **Keep Logs and Player Info Confidential**
   - Do not share logs or player info in tickets. This is to prevent harassment towards players and to keep our logging format confidential.

### 6. **Avoid Serving Bans in Your Own Scene**
   - Do not serve bans for scenes you were directly involved in unless absolutely necessary (e.g., modder, troll, confirmed F8).
   - In such cases, tap in another staff member and share your **POV** to ensure objectivity.

### 7. **The Same Applies to Personal Issues**
   - The same guideline applies to players you may have issues with. Avoid serving bans in these situations as well.
