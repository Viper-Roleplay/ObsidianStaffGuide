## 🚤 **How to Find a Player Boat When It 'Poofs'**

If a player opens a ticket about their boat being impounded and they can't access it, it’s likely gone to the **car impound**, but it isn't being picked up by the script since it’s a boat. Here’s how to handle it:
#RecoverVehicle #Boat #zdiscord #/command 
### Steps to Recover the Boat:

1. **Check the Boat Impound**  
   Use **zdiscord** to move it to the **boatimpound** garage.

   Command:  
   `/movecar (PLATE) boatimpound`

2. **If That Doesn’t Work**  
   If the boat still isn't accessible, the only option left is to delete the boat and **re-give** it to the player.

### Alternative Command:
You can also use zdiscord to move the boat to a specific garage if necessary:  
`/movecar (PLATE) (Garage Name)`
