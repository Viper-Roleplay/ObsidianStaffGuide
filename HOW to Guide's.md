## Liam's clean up guild

Easiest things to do would be:

Google 'page file size + your windows version' and change this windows setting that reserves hard drive space as RAM
Should be set to 1.5x your physically installed RAM
Search 'Graphics' in windows and enable the toggle in that window
Go down to 'Browse' find your FiveM and GTAV .exe files and add them, select them again select 'Options' and make sure they are both set to high performance.

These things together might take you 15 minutes if you really struggle but i'm sure you can figure it out

If you're still having issues chances are something is wrong and some easy things to quick diagnose / fix would be:

Check your tempatures! Many programs available but i would recommend hardware monitor (HWMonitor). This is very important to rule out, if your above 85 C - 90 C then your CPU is likely throttling itself to stay alive! Regular cleaning is required for your computer, if its been awhile then a good cleaning will likely solve your issue

Update your video drivers using your GPU software 
It will either be name Geforce Experience or AMD Adrenaline

Free up space and remove un-used programs
Sounds silly but its easy to forget about the games and programs you've downloaded over years. Lots of programs have weird conflicts that usually manifest in strange stutters or lag spikes
A really good program for this is called WinDirStat allows you to very easily see where your drive space is being used.


If you are really struggling and have genuinely done everything above, then its time to think about giving the computer a good ole refresh depending on how long its been.

If you've somewhat recently received / built your computer (less than 6months) then I would start with refreshing video drivers with a very good program called DDU (Direct Display Uninstaller)
This will allow you to re-install your video drivers as if you just installed windows

if it's been more than 8 months since you've built or received your computer than I would recommend re-installing windows This is something I personally will do when I'm struggling heavily with performance as windows gets bogged down very quickly over time. If you go this route you end up redownloading fresh drivers anyways and you fix any hidden program conflicts or deep rooted windows errors If you want to know how to do this i can give you some good links to learn (it's not very hard)

Any of the programs can be easily found via google. Get in the habit of using google as that is how I've learned all I know about computers!

Best of luck to you
